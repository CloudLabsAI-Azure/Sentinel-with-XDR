## Lab 01 - Setup Sentinel Workspace

## Lab overview
In the initial phase of setting up the security infrastructure, the focus is on creating essential components to monitor and analyze security events. This involves creating a Log Analytics workspace and a Microsoft Sentinel workspace, laying the foundation for subsequent security measures.

## Lab scenario

In this lab, you will undertake the essential task of setting up Log Analytics provides a centralized location to store and query data, while Sentinel serves as the platform for advanced security analysis. These workspaces enable proactive threat detection and incident response.


## Lab objectives ( Duration: 30 minutes)
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
- Task 1: Create a Log Analytics Workspace
- Task 2: Create Sentinel Workspace

1. From the Microsoft Sentinel page, select **+ Create**.

1. From Add Microsoft Sentinel to a workspace, select **+ Create a new workspace**.

1. From the basics tab of the Create Log Analytics workspace, enter the following and click **Review + Create**.   

    | Setting | Action |
    | -- | -- |
    | Subscription |  **Select the given subscription (1)**  |
    | Resource group | select ResourceGroup(sentinel-rg) |
