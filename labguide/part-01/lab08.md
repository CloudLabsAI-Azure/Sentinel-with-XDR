## Lab 08 - Ingest Logs from Azure Network security Groups

## Lab scenario

A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. In this lab, you configure the integration of Network security group logs with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to enable thorough security monitoring and analysis.

## Lab objectives (Duration: 45 minutes)
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
- Task 1: Ingesting logs from Azure Network security Groups to Sentinel

### Task 1: Ingesting logs from Azure Network Security Groups to Sentinel 

In this task, you will explore the Microsoft Sentinel .

1. On Azure Portal page, in **Search resources, services and docs (G+/)** box at the top of the portal, enter **Microsoft Sentinel**, and then select **Microsoft Sentinel** under services.

6. Click on **Install**.

1. Back on **Microsoft Sentinel | Data connectors** page and from left navigation pane select **Analytics** under **Configuration** section.

1. Now you need to setup a analytics rule to get alerts as a incident in the Sentinel, under **Rule templates** tab search for **Azure Network Security Group**  select 
  and **Create rule**.
   
1. Click on **Automated response** then **Review + create** and click on **Save**. This will create an alert rule.
   
1. Now you will be able to see the incidents generated by the Azure Network Security Group in **incidents** tab once you setup an alert rule.
  >**Note**: It will take 1 - 2 hours of time to generate **incidents** so kindly procced with next exercise.
