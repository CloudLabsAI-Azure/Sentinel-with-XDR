## Lab 06 - Ingest Logs from Microsoft Entra ID

## Lab Overview
Gain insights into Microsoft Entra ID by connecting Audit and Sign-in logs to Microsoft Sentinel to gather insights around Microsoft Entra ID scenarios. You can learn about app usage, conditional access policies, legacy auth relate details using our Sign-in logs. You can get information on your Self Service Password Reset (SSPR) usage, Microsoft Entra ID Management activities like user, group, role, app management using our Audit logs table.

## Lab scenario
Microsoft Entra ID is an integrated cloud identity and access solution. In this lab, you will enable the ingestion of logs from Microsoft Entra ID into Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution to enhance security monitoring and analytical capabilities.

## Lab objectives (Duration: 45 minutes)
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
- Task 1: Install Microsoft Entra ID data connector to Sentinel
- Task 2: Set up the data connector to ingest logs to workspace
- Task 3: View data ingested into Microsoft Sentinel

   rule**.
   
1. Click on **Automated response** then **Review + create** and click on **Save**. This will create an alert rule.
   
1. Now you will be able to see the incidents generated by the Microsoft Entra ID in **incidents** tab once you setup an alert rule.

   >**Note**: This may take 1 - 2 hours of time to generate **incidents**, please proceed to the next task. You can return to this step later to verify.
